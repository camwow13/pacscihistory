This is an archived section of [tidbits.pacsci.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20170404004938/http://tidbits.pacsci.org:80/museumphotos/PacificSciCenter/menu.html) created and curated by [David Taylor](https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/seattletimes/name/david-taylor-obituary?id=29327394) (1953-2005) in the late 90s and early 2000s showcasing some of the exhibits and projects he worked on during his 25 years at the Pacific Science Center in Seattle, Washington. It preserves a record of many long defunct exhibits at the science center.

This is a more complete version of the tidbits website's museum exhibit photos than what was snapshotted on the Internet Archive.

Special thanks to an anonymous redditor who made this archive in 2016 and gifted it to me to preserve Dave's website and the many fun science center exhibits it documents. If you have a copy of the rest of his website I'd love to see the rest of his museum photos one day!
